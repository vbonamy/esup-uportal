/**
 * Custom attribute source that can override the window state.
 *
 * This is intended for the JSON layout theme where it puts all the portlets
 * in minimized mode to reduce render cost.   It previously tried to set the
 * windowState on the PortletWindow object and then used a flag to disable
 * writing the window state to the DB.  Because the PortletWindow is
 * cached in the session, it would still break the layout for
 * each subsequent render in that session though.  New approach is to not
 * modify the PortletWindow and just customize the channel XML tag attributes
 * without ever updating the PortletWindow or persisting the windowState
 * change.
 *
 * See UP-4364
